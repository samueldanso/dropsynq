A SocialFi music platform where artists launch tokenized songs as tradable coins and earn directly from fans. It lets fans discover, trade, support rising talent, and share in the upside â€” creating a new way to connect and grow through music. Built on Zora.

## Problem

Artists struggle to monetize directly â€” traditional streaming platforms take large cuts and offer little control or ownership.
Fans have no direct way to invest in or own the music they love, or share in artistsâ€™ success â€” theyâ€™re just passive listeners.

## Solution

DropSynq enables artists to mint their songs as tokenized music coins on Zora, unlocking direct-to-fan monetization.
Fans can discover, buy, trade, and collect songs as assets â€” creating a new music economy where both artists and fans benefit.

## Features

- **ðŸŽµ Tokenized Song Drops** - Launch songs as music coins and earn directly from your fans.
- **ðŸ’± Trade & Own Music Coins** - Fans can invest in songs they love and directly support artists they believe in.
- **ðŸ’° Royalties and Rewards** - Artists earn automatically. Fans get early access, exclusive content, and upside potential.
- **ðŸ‘¥ Artists & Fan Profiles** - Showcase drops, collections, and build real connections between fans and artists.
- **ðŸ“Š Asset Portfolio Tracking** - View your holdings, activity, and build a valuable music asset collection.
- **ðŸ’¼ Seamless Onboarding** - Simple, secure login with wallets â€” powered by Privy.

## Zora Protocol Integration

DropSynq is built directly on top of Zoraâ€™s CoinV4 contract using the official SDK. Artists tokenize each song as a coin. This enables track ownership, tradability, and community monetization using Zoraâ€™s infrastructure.
